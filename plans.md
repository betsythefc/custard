 - [DONE] ~~Increase logged date to include hour, minute and second.~~
 - [DONE] ~~Add search criteria into the "reviews" page that allow someone to narrow down reviews based on the score, date and time, or the ID. (NOTE: Use PHP GET variables. The default should be "all" while when searching, it will take what is entered and reload the page.)~~
