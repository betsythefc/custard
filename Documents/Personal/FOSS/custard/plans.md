Planned changes:
v0.02 (2016-01-11)
------------------

v0.03:

 - Set up a bash shell install script to set up MySQL (Include a way to enter in a MySQL password for the custard_admin MySQL user) and install all dependencies (look at readme.md).
 - Add logic to the actual review links that will make sure only a 0, 1 or 2 is being added (no custom typing in numbers to URLs to add above 2 or below 0).
 - Need to "Prettify" the landing page after a review is submitted.
 - Learn how to make it so the folder path to these documents are not super long on git.
 - Add scaling to web page (currently looks great on 1366x768, but everything is out of whack on other resolutions).
 - implement a .gitignore file
